## Technical information about this website's accessibility

The Home Office is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites
and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.

## Compliance status

This website is not compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1][wcag-v2] AA standard. The
non-compliances and exemptions are listed below.


## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations
Thorough testing to confirm the accessibility of the website against the regulation requirements and WCAG 2.1 AA
standards is on our roadmap, however it has not been completed yet.

This is a failing on our part and means at this time we cannot confirm any known issues of non-compliance.

Because of this we stand ready to make reasonable adjustments for users until formal testing and proactive remediation
plans can be confirmed and ask any users that encounter accessibility issues to get in touch with us to receive support
and to notify us of issues so we can start making improvements.

### Disproportionate burden
At this time, we have not made any disproportionate burden claims.

### Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations

#### Internal systems
This system is described as an “intranet” within the definition of the regulations and the system originally went live
prior to September 2019.
As such this system does not need to be compliant until such time as it has been substantially revised.

We have chosen to produce this accessibility statement in advance to support our users and our requirements under the
Equality Act 2010 and Public Sector Equality Duty.

#### Archive with user generated content
This system is described as an “archive” within the definition of the regulations and the system originally went live
prior to September 2019 and only serves user generated content.
As such this system does not need to be compliant until such time as it has been substantially revised.

We have chosen to produce this accessibility statement in advance to support our users and our requirements under the
Equality Act 2010 and Public Sector Equality Duty.
