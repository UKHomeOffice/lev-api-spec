Viewable Data
========

Legislation currently only permits us to share our registration data widely with public sector bodies. We are undertaking some trials to understand the considerations for sharing data with the private sector and there are plans to review and revise data sharing powers to enable us to improve the use of Government data for an improved citizen on-line experience, particularly around identity verification and single sign-on to Government services.

We do not currently provide access to our service for individual citizens. However happy to understand any views on opportunities as input to our on-going review of introducing digital identity and verification services in the future.

The data any user can view will be dependent on the permissions of the user, regardless of whether we hold the data, even if the field is required in the JSON schema.

If you are unable to view a field you require then please email lev-enquiries@digital.homeoffice.gov.uk or raise an issue with your service desk.
