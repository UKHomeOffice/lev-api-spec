Look up and search for civil partnership records. Individual civil partnership records can be looked up using the `systemNumber` printed in the bottom-left of the civil partnership certificate. Alternatively, it is possible to search for civil partnership records by supplying the date of the civil partnership as well as the surname and at least the first forename of one of the partners.
